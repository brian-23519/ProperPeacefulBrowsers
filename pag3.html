      <p>One of the best bits of digital media is, instead of passively watching, reading 
      or listening, the page can respond to your actions. Moving, scrolling and zooming 
      elements around the page, entering and editing data, picking preferences and more 
      can all be done with interactive digital media.</p>
      
      <p>Simple interactivity can be done with the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) language 
      used on web sites. A simple example is the mouse over highlights of the links in 
      the nav bar above, but for more complex interactions you will need to learn a 
      programming language. </p>
      
      <p>There are a lot of programming languages out there, each with their own strengths 
      and weaknesses. When building web pages, there are two common languages used: 
      JavaScript and PHP.</p>
      
      <h2>JavaScript</h2>
      
      <P>JavaScript is a programming language designed to be read and processed by your 
      Web Browser. Originally used to make sure the data entered into an on-line form 
      was correct, it has developed into a powerful modern language that can be used to 
      handle anything from simple mouse clicks on a web page to writing on-line computer 
      games.</P>
      
      <h2>PHP</h2>
      
      <p>PHP is a little different from JavaScript in that it is designed to be read and 
      processed by a web server; a computer on the Internet that gives (serves) your 
      device web pages.</p>
      
      <p>It is most commonly used to make sure you get the data on your web pages you are 
      interested in, customising and personalising your experience. For example, if you 
      are reading a newsfeed, PHP can be used to only show news you are interested in.
      </p>
      
      <p>PHP isn't an abbreviation like HTML or CSS; it is just called PHP.</p>
